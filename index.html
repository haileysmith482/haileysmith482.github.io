      <p> Hi my name is Hailey Smith. This website is my portfolio of programs that I have written for my class CSC106 Computer Programming course I am taking online at the University of Rhode Island. I write this webpage myself using the skills I learned and HTML programming language. Everything on this page was carefully coded through github and transformed into an entire website! </p>
